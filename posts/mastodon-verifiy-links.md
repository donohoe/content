# Adding 
#### Nov 15th 2022

Mastodon allows you to add up to five links to display on your profile. You can easily verify yourself as the owner of the links in your profile metadata if you have full control of the page. However there are some services that you can still verify despite that. 

In these examples I use my own account information and you will substitue with yours. I'm also performing this on Desktop so steps may vary on mobile website and apps.

### Github:
* Open your Github Profile: https://github.com/donohoe
* Click the `Edit profile` button.
* In place of your personal site, paste the link to your mastodon profile.
* Click `Save`.

### Twitter
* Go to your Profile page settings: https://twitter.com/settings/profile
* Make a copy of your existing _Bio_ if you'd like to use it afterwards.
* Paste in the link to your mastodon profile as the _Bio_.
* Click `Save`.
* After saving, Twitter removes the leading `https://` but that's ok.

### Web Site
- This assumes you are able to edit the HTML directly. If so, add this:

```<a rel="me" href="https://octodon.social/@donohoe">Mastodon</a>```

## Update your Mastodon account
- After all (or any) of these steps, return to your Mastodon profile and edit it. 
- Add the relevent profile link an dlabel in the "Profile metadata". 
- Click `Save changes`.

That should be it.
