# Twitter Archive
#### 2022-11-26

Twitter was a really important service for me but that's changing quickly and I'm not too sure what happens next. What I do know is that I've been on the service for 16 years and that means something for me.

As Twitter goes into decline I wanted a home for my archive. As it stands the archive includes a lot of personal information and a lot of private messages. It would be nice to be able to put this up somewhere - safely and without all the unnecessary information.

This project is an attention to do that. [My archive is now here](https://donohoe.dev/twitter/). It's not fancy. I tend to want to do *everything* but I kept focused on solving one problem: a simple presence for my public tweets.

I did my best to make it available for other folks to use if they wanted something similar. Its [here](https://github.com/donohoe/twitter-archive) on Github:

Feedback welcome! I'm welcome PRs that address any of the following:

- Badly written code and bugs
- Expanding the tweet layout formats
- The build script in other langue's (Python etc) that perform exact same actions
