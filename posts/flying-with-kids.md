# Flying with Children
#### April 25th 2019

Your mileage will vary depending on age and disposition but this is what works for me.

### TSA Pre-Check via Global Entry
I hate this in principle but here I am. If you don't have this get Global Entry which includes TSA Pre. When you book your flight with children 12 and younger are covered by this. I would advise you to set a reminder 3 months before your childâ€™s 13 birthday to apply on their behalf.

### Nausea Medication
Dramamine is the go-to but you should ask your doctor about _Ondansetron Orally Disentegrating Tablets USP_ as they are prescription only. 

### Packing
* Vomit bags saved from previous flights plus tissues/wet-wipes, all in a ziplock back.
* Fun but healthier alternatives to over-priced airport snacks.
* Lip balm.
* Empty water bottle - fill after clearing security.
* Paperback books. Usually two, ideally one new.
* _Mad Libs_, pencils and a sketchpad go a long way.
* Charged iPod/device and headphones.
  * Bonus points for podcasts, music & audiobooks and no video.
  * Pack charger (or extra battery) and cable
* Download offline media the night before
    * Netflix and Amazon Prime support offline movies.
    * Spotify allows songs to be stored offline.
    * Update podcast subscriptions before you head to the airport.
* An extra light-layer.

### Boarding
* If you have a kid aged 2 (sometimes 3) you can board first.
  * With _American Airlines_ you need to ask in advance and they have discretion to allow slightly older ages.

### Seating
* When you fly into LGA, for the best view of NYC aim for a window seat on the left side of the cabin.
* Book the Aisle and Window seats in the hopes it remains empty. I've never had an issue asking someone to switch from that Middle seat when the gamble didn't work.
* Airlines are required to seat families with kids under the age of 13 together via FAA rules.
